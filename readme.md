# Changes from original ErgoDash

- Added rotary encoder (scroll wheel) in place of the ErgoDash's optional outer thumb buttons
- Removed speaker to make pin available for rotary encoder
- Replaced firmware backlight control with physical toggle switch to make pin available for rotary encoder
- Replaced some parts with ones easier to obtain in the UK
- Added jumper pin positions for backlight switch and spare keyboard switch to allow adding functionality later

# Firmware

The ErgoDash-R uses QMK for its firmware. It will need updating from the original ErgoDash firmware here:

# Build Guide

I will add a build guide once I have finished building mine! The original ErgoDash build guide is likely to be useful:
